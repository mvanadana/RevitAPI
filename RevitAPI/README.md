# Creating "Hello World" Project Using Revit API
## Overview
This README outlines the steps I followed to create a "Hello World" project using the Autodesk Revit API. The project aims to display a simple message within Revit using a TaskDialog.

## Steps
1. Setting Up the Development Environment
Installed Visual Studio with .NET Framework support.
Ensured Autodesk Revit was installed and accessible.
2. Creating a New Revit API Project
Opened Visual Studio and created a new C# Class Library (.NET Framework) project.
Added necessary references to Autodesk.Revit.DB and Autodesk.Revit.UI assemblies.
3. Implementing the External Command
Created a new class Class1 that implements IExternalCommand.
Added necessary attributes ([Autodesk.Revit.Attributes.Transaction]) for command execution.
4. Implementing Command Execution Logic
Inside the Execute method:Utilized TaskDialog.Show method to display the "Hello World" message.
Ensured the command returned Result.Succeeded upon completion.
5. Building and Testing
Built the solution to compile the code and generate the DLL file.
Loaded the compiled plugin DLL into Revit by placing it in the appropriate Addins folder.
Opened Revit and executed the "Hello World" command to test the functionality.
6. Review and Further Development
Ensured the message appeared as expected within Revit using the TaskDialog.
Reviewed the code, made improvements, and considered potential enhancements for future functionality.

## Class1.cs:
Contains the main command logic.
## RevitAPI.csproj: 
Project file with configurations and references.
Other files: Any additional files created or used in the project.
## Conclusion
Following these steps, I successfully created a "Hello World" project using the Revit API. This project serves as a starting point for further development and exploration of the Revit API's capabilities.
